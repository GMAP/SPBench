* v0.4.1-alpha
  - Operators edition
  - UPL now can be disabled to avoid architectural incompatibility issues
  - Min and max latency now show the moment in time where it they were registered
  - Fixed bug with lane detection output correctness check

* v0.4-alpha

  - General:
    - new batching mode: by time interval
    - new feature: frequency patterns (for n-sources benchmarks it is only globally available)
    - yasm(v1.3.0) library is now provided within SPBench
  
  - Metrics:
    - new metric: instantaneous throughput
    - new metric: instantaneous latency
    - metric update: benchmark monitoring now registers also current frequency and batch size (not available for n-sources)
    - metric update: benchmark monitoring now uses the same instantaneous metrics system
    - metric update: average latency now displays min and max latency
  
  - CLI:
    - new feature: users now can use the exec argument '-repeat <n_repetitions>' to run a benchmark n times
    - new feature: users now can use -app and -ppi filters to select multiple benchmarks to execute
  
  - Workload:
    - new workload classes: Test and Huge
    - new input video for lane detection with low-quality (360p) and mid-quality (720p) options.
  
  - Other:
    - frequency parameter is now defined as items per second instead of item interval
    - update in the frequency control: now the waiting time is added before the item reading at source
    - update in the frequency control: now it counts the processing time of the previous item in the source as part of the waiting time
    - PPI update: FastFlow release 3 was replaced by its last version available in the github repository (august 2022)
    - new benchmark: pipe-farm ferret-fastflow using all-to-all inter-farm communication
    - benchmark update: improved implementation for ferret-fastflow pipe-farm
